## SCRIPT

Let's say that we have a
fixed-length array of five items.

## PUSH

The simplest way to add an
item to an array is using
the push operation.

This takes an item and adds
it to the first empty
slot in the array.

Since we're keeping track
of how many items are
in the array,
this operation is O(1).

## Multi-push

Before we get to
our next operation,
let's push some more items.

## INSERT

Oh no! We've forgotten to
push one into the array.

To resolve this,
we can use the insert operation
which requires us to pass
an index along with the item,
to instruct the operation
where in the array
we would like to place our item.

This operation requires us to
make space for our new item,
so we have to move all the
items over one space to the right.

This operation is O(N),
with N representing the number
of items currently in the array.

## POP

Similar to push,
we can use the pop operation
to remove the last item
of an array.

This operation is O(1).

## DELETE

The final operation we're
covering is to remove
from a particular index.

It's essentially the reverse
of what we did for insert:
we remove the item at the
index we pass in,
and then move each item
to the left one-by-one.

This operation is O(N).
